LIGMA is part of the BOFA spectrum of conditions. LIGMA (Loose Internal Gene Mi-Asintits) 
is the second stage of BOFA (Biologically Offset Farkwnian Asintits). In this state, the 
disease interferes with the immune system and increases the risk of developing common infections 
such as tuberculosis. Given the weakened immune system, many of the patients, such as popular 
Fortnite streamer Ninja, die on this stage of the Biologically Offset Farkwonian Asintits (BOFA). 
It is also the last treatable stage. Although not effectrie. there are treatments to LIGMA: 
LIGMA-BALLS (Bi-Asonurdick Lateral Lactatioustits Sequence) that, even though itâ€™s experimental, 
have shown some promise. With stopping the spread of BOFA at the LIGMA stages, it can stop patients 
from going into the third and final phase of the BOFA sequence: ETMA, (Entrenched Terminal Mi-Asintits)
